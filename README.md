# ASCON

Ascon is a family of authenticated encryption and hashing algorithms designed to be lightweight and easy to implement, even with added countermeasures against side-channel attacks. Ascon has been selected as the primary choice for lightweight authenticated encryption in the final portfolio of the CAESAR competition (2014–2019) and is currently competing in the NIST Lightweight Cryptography competition (2019–).

Our Implementation of ASCON cryptography Algorithm using Assembly for the following processors
- Intel 32 , 64 bit
- MIPS 32 bit
- RISC-V 32 bit

The purpose of our Implementaion is to analyse the algorithm and make it easier for future hardware integration.
